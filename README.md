This flowchart shows individuals involved in wrestling in some capacity (e.g., Aalyah, who was involved in a storyline). While it notes blood relations, the primary structure is trainer-to-prodigy based. Red boxes indicate a blood relation to the trainer, and blue boxes indicate no confirmed blood relation (Jr./Dom aside â€“ that's a joke!). Wrestlers with gray backgrounds appear to be inactive (though this has not been fully validated).

These are my next steps:
- [x] Move the flowchart to GitHub or another collaborative platform.
- [ ] Add links to wrestler profiles or landing pages to serve as sources.
- [ ] Add birth/death dates where appropriate.
- [ ] Add years active.
- [ ] Identify any wrestlers missing from the subsequent generation(s).
- [ ] Note the promotions they are currently most active in.
